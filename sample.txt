Well, well, well...it's that time of year again, isn't it? Your birthday, the day we celebrate the fact that you managed to survive another year without accidentally killing yourself. Congrats, I guess.

I hope your special day is as amazing as you think it is. I mean, it's not like it's just another day that people feel obligated to make you feel special. It's not like they would ignore you for the other 364 days of the year. No, no, today is your day, and you should definitely milk it for all it's worth.

I hope you're ready for the onslaught of generic birthday messages from people who wouldn't give you the time of day if it weren't for Facebook notifications. You know, the same people who never talk to you, never check in on you, and never care about you, but they'll make sure to write "HBD" on your wall just so they can feel like they did something nice.

And let's not forget about the birthday cake. Oh, the cake. The one time of year where you can eat an entire cake by yourself and not feel guilty about it. But wait, there's more! You get to blow out candles, too! What a thrill! You get to sit there and watch as people sing a song that's been sung to you every year since you were born, all while making a wish that won't come true.

But hey, at least you're getting older, right? Another year closer to death. Another year of your metabolism slowing down, your wrinkles getting deeper, and your memory fading. But don't worry, you still have plenty of time left to do all the things you've been putting off. Like traveling the world, getting in shape, or finding true love. I'm sure it will all happen soon.

And let's not forget about the gifts. Ah, the gifts. The one time of year where people feel obligated to spend money on you. But don't get too excited, it's not like you're getting anything you actually want. No, you'll get generic gift cards, ugly sweaters, and useless knick-knacks that will collect dust in the back of your closet.

So, happy birthday! Enjoy your day of forced celebration and fake niceties. And remember, you're one year closer to being just another forgotten memory in the minds of those around you. But hey, at least you have cake, right?
